<h1>Preparing texts for CLiCTagger<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-texts-for-clictagger" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Whilst CLiCTagger can work on any plain text, for best results text should be prepared using the method below.
Any texts added to the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora">corpora repository</a> should follow this process.</p>
<p>To clean texts so they are ready for use with CLiCTagger, the following steps need to be followed.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#convert-to-unix-line-endings">Convert to unix line endings</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#remove-non-authorial-text">Remove non-authorial text</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#reformat-the-book-title-and-author-to-make-consistent-across-all-texts">Reformat the book title and author to make consistent across all texts</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#reformat-chapter-headings-to-make-consistent-across-all-texts">Reformat chapter headings to make consistent across all texts</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="#manual-corrections">Manual corrections</a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If committing to the corpora repository, each editing stage is committed and clearly documented with a commit message.
Accordingly, it is possible to see the history of a single file, see for example the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commits/master/ChiLit/willows.txt">history of willows.txt</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="convert-to-unix-line-endings">
<h2>Convert to unix line endings<a class="headerlink" href="#convert-to-unix-line-endings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Step [1] is achieved using the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>for f in ChiLit/*.txt; do dos2unix -m $f; done
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="remove-non-authorial-text">
<h2>Remove non-authorial text<a class="headerlink" href="#remove-non-authorial-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Tables of content are removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Lists of illustrations are removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Any preface text attributed to a person other than the author is
removed. When attribution is unclear the text is left.</p></li>
<li><p>Any postface text attributed to a person other than the author is
removed. When attribution is unclear the text is left.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcriber notes are removed.</p></li>
<li><p>In the texts illustrations are usually indicated by text enclosed in
square brackets. Where this text includes a caption the caption is
kept, for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[Illustration: THE WONDERSTONE.]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>becomes:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[THE WONDERSTONE.]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Where there is no authorial caption the construct is deleted. All
the following example would be deleted:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[Illustration]

[Illustration: Chapter Seventeen]

[Illustration: Page 91]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the case of <cite>sketches</cite>, the line:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>[Picture which cannot be reproduced]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>was removed during editing, because other editions suggested that the line was
not part of the text but rather an editorial remark (see the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/c72cc1809c22c3f45f2e3158df87545fdce58d28#r32025083">comment on the change</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Footnotes</strong> are removed if they are attached to the end of a text but left in if the footnote text
is included in main text. (This rule was formally introduced for the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/c72cc1809c22c3f45f2e3158df87545fdce58d28#diff-b90e831a9520a85b9e7620aa1fac6591L25366">expansion of the ArTs corpus, 2019-01</a>, although it was likely also followed implicitly for the previous corpora).
When removing footnotes, delete both the in-text footnote indicator and the footnote itself.
In the following example from <cite>sketches</cite>, the {161} in the text <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/c72cc1809c22c3f45f2e3158df87545fdce58d28#diff-b90e831a9520a85b9e7620aa1fac6591L7281">was removed</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>On both sides of the gaol, is a small
receiving-room, to which prisoners are conducted on their first
reception, and whence they cannot be removed until they have been
examined by the surgeon of the prison. {161}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/c72cc1809c22c3f45f2e3158df87545fdce58d28#diff-b90e831a9520a85b9e7620aa1fac6591L26670">along with the footnote text</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>{161}  The regulations of the prison relative to the confinement of
prisoners during the day, their sleeping at night, their taking their
meals, and other matters of gaol economy, have been all altered-greatly
for the better—since this sketch was first published.  Even the
construction of the prison itself has been changed.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note this is just one of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/c72cc1809c22c3f45f2e3158df87545fdce58d28#diff-b90e831a9520a85b9e7620aa1fac6591L26663">four footnotes removed in “sketches”</a>.
Other books for which footnotes were removed include <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/c72cc1809c22c3f45f2e3158df87545fdce58d28#diff-97c35dfce2b9f9b909ebb3f89ae43e2c">“americannotes”</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/c72cc1809c22c3f45f2e3158df87545fdce58d28#diff-dae9e8214d88284bc935c3a2b5ebce82">“pictures”</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/c72cc1809c22c3f45f2e3158df87545fdce58d28#diff-f573870f5118cfc91ff22ca3de87a75f">“uncommercial”</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, an example of a footnote that was retained because it was fully included
in the main text is the following in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/blob/ca01d2ae9731b7a43d469422b85deb0bc1c486f3/ArTs/timemachine.txt#L2231">“timemachine”</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she
startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have
noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may
be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was
built into the side of a hill.—ED.]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>ChiLit also contains examples of retained footnotes, for example several in <em>rival</em>,
such as the following (<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/blob/ca01d2ae9731b7a43d469422b85deb0bc1c486f3/ChiLit/rival.txt#L2504">see location in text</a>):</p>

board, and the Diomede in tow; and, having favourable winds and a smooth
sea, we contrived to get the hulk into the King&#39;s dock at Rio de
Janeiro; where, being a fine new ship, she was found worth repairing and
refitting; and here we have been ever since, the Portuguese workmen
being very slow in their operations.&quot;[6]

[Footnote 6: Commodore Byron found some repairs necessary at Rio de
Janeiro.--&quot;We had six Portuguese caulkers to assist our carpenters, who
were paid at the rate of 6s. per diem; though it is certain an English
caulker could do as much in one day as they did in three; but, though
slow and inactive, they perform their work very effectually.&quot;

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>book title</strong> is put on the first line of the file, without any

<li><p>The <strong>book author</strong> is put on the second line of the file, without any
newlines. Check whether the CLiC corpora already contain other texts from this author
and ensure that the spelling of the name is consistent in the text to be added.
If the presentation of the name differs slightly (e.g. a full name vs. initials of first name)
then CLiC will consider the two names as different authors and give them distinct author entries
in the dropdown menu. Sometimes Gutenberg texts also contain additional titles in front of a name
(e.g. “Baron”, “Captain”, “Earl”). We try to use the format that is/was most commonly used for the
author. Most important is, though, to use one format consistently for the same author.</p></li>
<li><p>Both the <strong>book title</strong> and the <strong>book author</strong> should be in title case
(<em>not</em> in all capitals! - that would confuse the CLiC client), for example:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>American Notes for General Circulation

</pre></div>

</ul>

<div class="section" id="reformat-chapter-headings-to-make-consistent-across-all-texts">
<h2>Reformat chapter headings to make consistent across all texts<a class="headerlink" href="#reformat-chapter-headings-to-make-consistent-across-all-texts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Chapter headings</strong> are formatted as follows: If the chapter heading
begins with ‘CHAPTER’ or ‘BOOK’ it must be followed by a number or
roman numerals and then a dot. The chapter or book number cannot be
written in word form. The heading can optionaly be followed by a
chapter title; the chapter title must not break onto a new line.
Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>CHAPTER 1. The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow

CHAPTER 2. TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.

CHAPTER 3.

CHAPTER IV. Little Meg&#39;s Treat to Her Children

CHAPTER V.

BOOK 1.

BOOK II. Jessica&#39;s Mother
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Sections beginning with ‘INTRODUCTION’, ‘PREFACE’, ‘CONCLUSION’,
‘PROLOGUE’, ‘PRELUDE’ or ‘MORAL’ are also be treated as seperate
chapters. These do not require numbers, but do require the dot.
Again the heading can optionaly be followed by a title; the title
must not break onto a new line. Here are some examples:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>PREFACE.

INTRODUCTION.

PROLOGUE. THE OLYMPIANS

MORAL.--_There is no moral to this chapter._
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In all cases there must be no space at the beginning of the line.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Part headings</strong> are on a line before the first chapter of that part,
in the same format (i.e. “PART” has to be followed by a Roman or Arabic
numeral). Blank lines are allowed between the part heading and the chapter
heading. The following example is from <cite>treasure</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>PART 2. The Sea-cook




CHAPTER 7. I Go to Bristol

IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea,
and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey&#39;s, of keeping me
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the CLiC dropdown menu, the part and chapter headings are joined together,
i.e. this <cite>treasure</cite> chapter is shown as “PART 2. The Sea-cook CHAPTER 7. I Go to Bristol”.
Whereas <cite>treasure</cite> contains “PART” headings in the original text that only had to
be <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/birmingham-ccr/corpora/commit/b3bf771a72a523554fbec011dfaf6e44d35b1ae8#diff-833d382b4e9e60c1c7f9182dd7ebd234">reformatted</a>, sometimes “PART” (and a number) has to be added
to the existing headings in order to represent the structure of the book correctly
in the CLiC dropdown menu. An example where the headings had to be adjusted accordingly
is <cite>sketches</cite>. The table of contents in a <a class="reference external" href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.501383/page/n7">scanned copy of the book</a>
illustrates its nested structure. This table of contents does not reproduce all levels;
for example, the chapters within “CHARACTERS” and “TALES” contain a further level of chapters.
As CLiC can only handle parts and chapters but no third level, we solved this issue by first adding
the numbered parts to the headings (“PART 4.” in the following), joining it with the top
chapter level (“CHAPTER I. THE BOARDING-HOUSE”) and therefore accounting for the extra chapter level (CHAPTER I.)
on level 2:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>PART 4. TALES CHAPTER I. THE BOARDING-HOUSE


 CHAPTER I.
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These extra levels are not very frequent in <cite>sketches</cite>, but when they occur, they are not
necessarily numbered conventionally but e.g. “CHAPTER THE SECOND”. In that instance, we added
only “CHAPTER” to count this as a chapter:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The advertisement has again appeared in the morning papers.  Results must
be reserved for another chapter.


CHAPTER. CHAPTER THE SECOND.


‘Well!’ said little Mrs. Tibbs to herself, as she sat in the front
parlour of the Coram-street mansion one morning, mending a piece of
stair-carpet off the first Landings;—‘Things have not turned out so
badly, either, and if I only get a favourable answer to the
advertisement, we shall be full again.’
